# Vision with C++

This section covers C++ programming techniques and libraries commonly used in computer vision applications, with a focus on performance optimization and best practices.

## Overview

C++ is widely used in computer vision for its performance and flexibility. This documentation covers:

- Eigen library for linear algebra
- Performance optimization techniques
- Best practices for vision applications
- Integration with other vision libraries

## Getting Started

To get started with C++ for computer vision:
1. Review the Eigen library basics
2. Learn performance optimization techniques
3. Understand best practices for vision applications
4. Explore integration with other libraries
