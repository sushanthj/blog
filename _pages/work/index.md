## Research & Extra-Curriculars

In grad school I did some part-time research at [Kantor Lab](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/kantorlab/research/) within CMU's Field Robotics Center, working on Robotics for Agriculture. I worked on a robotic grapevine pruning project involving 3D skeletonization of grapevine pointclouds for pruning weight estimation.

During undergrad I lead a student robotics team called [Edhitha](https://www.edhitha.com/) which has continuously taken part at the [AUVSI SUAS](https://suas-competition.org/)
competition held at Maryland, USA. We finished 5th amongst 60 international teams in 2016.
