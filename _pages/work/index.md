title: Some Skills, All Anxiety...
subtitle: My interests in robotics started during undergrad through a student team called <a href="https://www.edhitha.com/">Edhitha</a>, focused on autonomous aerial systems. Then I got to deploy robots to the real world at <a href="https://niqorobotics.com/">Niqo Robotics</a> and finally moved soon after to the US for my <a href="https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/">Master's in Robotic Systems Development</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Education

In 2024, I earned my [Master's in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) from Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Computer Vision.

## Current Work

I currently work at Intuitive Surgical on ML and computer vision for navigation and guidance in surgical robots. I work on 3D Reconstruction (Gaussian Splatting, NeRFs), Detection and Classification, and Monocular Depth Estimation.

## Previous Work

#### Niqo Robotics

I worked at [Niqo Robotics](https://niqorobotics.com/) as a robotics engineer on argicultural robots. This was a super hands-on role where I got to develop the systems as well as see it through deployment on remote farms across the country. I primarily worked on computer vision (detection and depth estimation) as well as TensorRT optimization.

#### Magna International

This was my 2023 summer internship in Detroit where I worked on sensor fusion (fusing camera and radar) for L2 ADAS features in cars. It was a nice real-life learning on EKFs in an optimized C++ codebase.

## Research & Extra-Curriculars

In grad school I did some part-time research at [Kantor Lab](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/kantorlab/research/) within CMU's Field Robotics Center, working on Robotics for Agriculture. I worked on a robotic grapevine pruning project involving 3D skeletonization of grapevine pointclouds for pruning weight estimation.

During undergrad I lead a student robotics team called [Edhitha](https://www.edhitha.com/) which has continuously taken part at the [AUVSI SUAS](https://suas-competition.org/)
competition held at Maryland, USA. We finished 5th amongst 60 international teams in 2016.
