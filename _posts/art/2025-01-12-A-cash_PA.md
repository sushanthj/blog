This was a long due gift for a friend who plays this character in DoTA2. I designed a poster back in 2020 and only now got to finish it in Jan 2026!

## Design and Development

### Vecotrization from a reference image

This was the most time consuming part (~6 hours) back when there was no AI-assisted vectorization. I used Adobe Illustrator and it had a decent learning curve.

### SolidWorks and 3D Printing

The vector image was exported as a DXF and used directly in Solidworks to form a sketch. The remaining assembly was built around that.

I had to optimize the assembly to be easy to pack and carry without breaking any components. This meant printing most structures flat on the print bed.
