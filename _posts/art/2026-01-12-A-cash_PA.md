This was a long due gift for a friend with whom I play Dota2. I designed a poster back in 2020 and only now got to finish it in Jan 2026!

## Design and Development

### Vecotrization from a reference image

This was the most time consuming part (~6 hours) back when there was no AI-assisted vectorization. I used Adobe Illustrator and it had a decent learning curve.

### SolidWorks and 3D Printing

- The vector image was exported as a DXF and used directly in Solidworks to form a sketch. The remaining assembly was built around that.
- I had to optimize the assembly to be easy to pack and carry without breaking any components. This meant printing most structures flat on the print bed.

### Backlights and Paper Printing

- To introduce hue-based lighting effects, I added an LED strip that serves as a night light and can be conveniently controlled via Alexa or Google Home.
- The foreground and background colors would be better with glossy paper, but I had to settle for a ordinary office print quality.
