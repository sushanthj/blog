During undergrad I lead a student robotics team called [Edhitha](https://www.edhitha.com/) which has continuously taken part at the [AUVSI SUAS](https://suas-competition.org/)
competition held at Maryland, USA. We finished 5th amongst 60 international teams in 2016.

I love flying RC planes and it's something I've been wanting to try again in California!
