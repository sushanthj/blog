## Instructions

### Blanching Phase

Here's why blanching is useful
- Preservation : Deactivates enzymes that cause loss of flavor, color, and texture.
- Color Enhancement : Makes vegetables like green beans bright green.

1. Blanch the palak by immersing it in boiling water for 2 minutes
2. Then transfer to a vessel and add ice or cold water to cool it down fast

### Tadka für Blender Phase 

1. Add 2 tablespoon of oil in a pan and heat
2. Add the cumin seeds, green chilly, ginger, and onions. Let it fry for a minute
3. Add garlic and saute for another 2 minutes
4. Finally add chopped tomato and fry till the tomato becomes soft
5. Let it cool down a little

### Blender Phase
1. Add the palak (already cooled) and the above Tadka (also cooled) into a blender
2. Add the cashew nuts
3. Blend until the cashew is thoroughly dissolved (cashew chunks mess up texture)

### Final Tadka Phase
1. Heat 3 tablespoon cooking oil (or ghee) in a pan (heat oil to raise temperature and then reduce the flame to min)
2. Add the following
   1. Cumin powder
   2. Red chilly powder
   3. Coriander powder
   4. Turmeric powder
3. Let it fry a bit (keep stirring if not the powder sticks to the pan)
4. Add the blender contents (palak and veggies and a tiny bit of water if necessary) and cook for 3 minutes. 
5. Add cream and mix
6. Add garam masala and salt
7. Finally add paneer, mix, and cook for 2-3 minutes. Let it cool a bit before consuming.

## Tips
