All proportions below are optimized for a MagicBullet blender (~20oz)

## Ingredients

- **Curry leaves** : 3 leaves
- **Cumin** : 1.5 teaspoon
- **Garlic** : 3
- **Green chilly** : 4
- **Tamarind Concentrate** : 1 teaspoon

- **Channa Dal (Roasted Bengal Gram / Split Chickpeas)** : 1.5 Tablespoon

## Instructions

### Tadka Phase
1. Heat some cooking oil in a pan (I've even used Olive Oil and it's perfectly fine)
2. Add cumin, curry leaves, and stir for 30 seconds
3. Add green chilly and stir fry for 20 seconds
4. Switch off the heat and add mint leaves, stir for 20 seconds

### Blender Phase
1. In an empty blender bowl, add grated coconut, garlic, coriander, channa dal
2. Add the tadka to the blender as well
3. Finally, add the tamarind concentrate and 4oz of water and blend

## Tips

I usually take at least 3 iterations to get the chutney right, so please be patient!
