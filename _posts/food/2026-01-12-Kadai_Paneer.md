5. Add 3 chopped and deseeded tomatoes and cook until oil separates (again it's okay for this to be super dry we'll add water later)

### 2nd Wok Fry Phase

I don't have a wok at home, but any Non-stick pan should do. I use a steel pan because I like pain ._.

1. In a separate wok, heat 2 teaspoon oil
2. Add the cut bell peppers, tomato triangles, and onion petals, paneer triangles
3. Add 1 teaspoon garam masala and 1/2 teaspoon salt
4. Stir fry on high flame for about 3 minutes (the veggies should be crunchy, not soft)


### Final Mix and Saute Phase

1. Add the contents of the wok into the first saute pan
2. Add 1/2 cup of water to adjust consistency
3. Cook for 2 minutes on medium flame
4. Add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi and mix well
5. Optionally add 1 Tablespoon fresh cream and mix well
6. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and ginger juliennes
