## Ingredients 
- **Rice** : 0.5 cup
- **Baby Carrots** : 5
- **Garlic** : 2 cloves crushed or 1/2 Tablespoon paste
- **Onion** : 1/2 cut thin
- **Lao Gan Ma (chilly oil)** : 2 Tablespoon
- **Dark Soy Sauce**


## Instructions

### Rice
Since I want the rice to be a bit harder than usual to keep texture, I just wash the rice and pressure cook for 3 minutes in the InstantPot.

### Tadka Phase
1. Cut the above mentioned quantities of carrots, onion, and beans and chop them fine.
2. Put little water, 1/2 small spoon of salt and little bit garlic and Italian seasoning and keep in microwave for 5 minutes. Salt is a bit optional tbh because soy sauce and chilli oil will have salt
3. Heat 1TBSP of oil in a pan and before oil get's too hot add the veggies
4. After veggies add the garlic paste
5. Add chilli oil
6. Add rice and mix well
7. Add a slight (little bit) of soy sauce. Be careful because too much soy sauce makes it weird 

## Tips

The soy sauce needs to hit the hot oil pan first. So make space by pushing the veggies to the side and exposing the steel below. Add small quantities to ensure it sizzles out well.
