## Tips

- Adding a tinge (1 teaspoon) of [Green Goodnes](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/green-goddess-seasoning-blend-071294) seasoning from Trader Joe's can add a new dimension of taste!
- Similarly a tinge (1/2 teaspoon) of [Umami](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/tjs-mushroom-company-multipurpose-umami-seasoning-blend-063804) seasoning from Trader Joe's makes the taste a little more grounded
