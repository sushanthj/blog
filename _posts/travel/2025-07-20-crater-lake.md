# Crate Lake and Mt. Shasta

It's a perfect three day vacation from the bay area. About a 6 hour drive away, we started on a friday evening and stayed at city close to Crater lake. The next day (Saturday) was spent going around Crater lake--also taking a dip in the cold water lake 🥶. Then we headed back on Sunday and visited Mt. Shasta which is along the way.

## Places Visited

- 📍 Cleetwood Clove Trail : The only one that goes down into the water
- 📍 Watchman Peak Trail : Amazing for sunsets
- 📍 Lake Siskiyou : Great for kayaking and water activities!
