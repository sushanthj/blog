# Death Valley

Easily my favourite national park in the US so far.

It's a long drive from the Bay Area (about 8 hours) but totally worth it. We started on early on a Saturday morning but drove non-stop to reach the entrance of the valley by 11AM. All the places in the valley are a must visit. October or November is a great time to visit as the weather is not too hot.

## Pismo Beach (Side Trip)

We stopped at Pismo beach on the way back. It's a very happening beach town and great to walk around. I went there again because I loved the atmosphere so much.
